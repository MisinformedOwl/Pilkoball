# Pilkoball
I recreated plinko ball from the gambling website Stake

## How to play
Really shrimple, you just launch the exe and it should boot up, you may require java. I have not checked this. Nor do i really plan to, if having trouble. just download processing.js and you should get everything you need realistically.

### Controls
Click to drop a ball. Your bank value will go down as you click depending on how much you have betted.

Scroll up to increase the betting ammount.
And scroll down to decrease it.

## Other information
If the ball falls out of the area, L no money for you. Get owned bozo.
